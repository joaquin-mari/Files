This project was our focus during the Start Hack 2024 Hackathon, where my team and I took on the challenge presented by the University of St. Gallen: developing a Nutrition Management app. The core question we tackled was: "How can we make food tracking not just effective but genuinely attractive?". After a solid 36 hours of hacking away, here's what we came up with.

My role centered around crafting the app's graphical interface using React and Vite. Unfortunately, we ran short on time to complete the back-end. However, we did manage to find source some code online for a pre-trained model used in food recognition. The remaining task was to build a functional back-end to manage the data from the model, but time constraints prevented us from doing so.

Please note, following packages might be needed to install: react-minimal-pie-chart, react-icons, react-webcam
