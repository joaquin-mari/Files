Heyy!! these are some of the projects I've been working on lately,
all of them except for the weather app were done completely on my own without the help
of any YouTube tutorials. This means that the code written there is far from perfect ðŸ˜…
but at least it's mine and doing these projects really helped me learn a lot :D

Hope you guys like it!!
